How to execute:
I have added LoginTest.test.js under the integration folder which contains the code for automation.
Please open the terminal and enter .\node_modules\.bin\cypress open the cypress window.
From there you can run the file.

Note:
I have completed the automation task both in Cypress and Selenium.
Since I have working experience in selenium BDD, I was able to solve the task without any issues.
Even though I have limited knowledge of Cypress since I have worked on selenium throughout my career, I was able to complete the Automation task by learning it. 
I have faced many issues while creating the script, I did the research and could able to solve the problem.
On the given chance, I can ramp up myself on Cypress and exhibit my automation skills. In addition to that, I have a basic understanding of Javascript.
